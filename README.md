# Swiftly - CS2 Lua Extension

This extension is adding autocomplete for lua scripts on Swiftly - Counter Strike 2.

This extension is using the [Lua Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) from Sumneko for adding autocomplete.

In addition to autocomplete, this extension also allows you to quickly generate a new plugin structure. You can do this by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and running the SwiftlyCS2: Generate Plugin command. This will create a basic plugin template that you can start customizing immediately.
